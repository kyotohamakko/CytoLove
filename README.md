Reconstruction of fiber network of artificial data
Run the script "CytoLove_artifact.m" to reconstruct the graph representation of a hand make crossing fiber.
Image data has been uploaded in the folder "data". 

Reconstruction of the actin network
Run the script "CytoLove_actin.m" to reconstruct the graph representation of actin.
By setting actin_type = "cortex" of actin_type = "lamilipodia" to decide which type of actin to reconstruct.
Image data has been uploaded in the folder "data". 

Angle distribution of actin
After execute "CytoLove_actin.m", result will be saved in the folder "save". Run the script "angle_distribution.m" to read the reconstruction result and calculate the angle distribution.
