Reconstruction of fiber network of artificial data

Run the script "reconstruct_artifact.m" in folder "review" to reconstruct the graph representation of a hand make crossing fiber.
Image data has been uploaded in the folder "review/data". 

Reconstruction of the actin network

Run the script "reconstruct_actin.m" in folder "review" to reconstruct the graph representation of actin.
By setting actin_type = "cortex" of actin_type = "lamilipodia" to decide which type of actin to reconstruct.
Image data has been uploaded in the folder "review/data". 

Angle distribution of actin

After executing "reconstruct_actin.m" in folder "review", result will be saved in the folder "review/save". Run the script "angle_distribution.m" in folder "review" to read the reconstruction result and calculate the angle distribution.
